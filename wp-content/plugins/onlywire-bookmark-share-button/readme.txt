== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I change the look and feel of the Button? =

Visit the Settings->OnlyWire tab in your WordPress admin tool.  You will see the ability to customize the look and feel of your Button - colors, fonts, sizes, etc...

= Is this free? =

Yes, you can use OnlyWire for FREE for up to 300 submissions per month (a submission is one post to one service, i.e. Twitter).  After 300 submissions, you must upgrade to a paid account.  Pricing starts at $10 per month for up to 1000 submissions.  OnlyWire's system also performs captcha solving for an additional fee.

= What makes OnlyWire better than AddThis.com or ShareThis.com? =

OnlyWire is the only service which auto-submits content to multiple sites simultaneously.  AddThis and ShareThis only allow readers to submit to one site at a time.  OnlyWire has built this submission technology from the ground up, and we are constantly making improvements to streamline the process for users worldwide.  Hundreds of thousands of bloggers and publishers depend on OnlyWire to drive traffic and syndicate content.

= Is the OnlyWire Plugin Compatible With WordPress MU? =

Currently, the OnlyWire plugin is **not** compatible with WordPress MU. We may add support for WordPress MU in the future should it be requested.

== Coming Soon ==

Send us your feedback [http://onlywire.com/contact](http://onlywire.com/contact "From Our Contact Page") and we'll add more features!

The next time you submit a post, OnlyWire will auto-submit your content to all of your sites simultaneously.  Any sites that require extra steps (such as captcha) are completed via a process we call "Finalization".  This is a streamlined process in which you can submit all of your captcha responses in one page. 
3. When you add a new post to your WordPress blog, you will see a new checkbox that allows you to instantly publish the post to your OnlyWire account and syndicate it to over 30 social networks.
4. Under your WordPress settings bar, you will see OnlyWire Options which allows you to change the look and feel of your Button that appears under articles.
