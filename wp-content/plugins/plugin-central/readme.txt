== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have problems installing new plugins =

Plugin Central currently relies on file permissions set up correctly on your server, in order to write files to your plugin folder. Some servers require ftp login details to write the files and Plugin Central will support this option in the future.

= How does installing plugins by name work? =

If you type just a name of the plugin you want to install, Plugin Central will search the WordPress Plugin Repository and try to find a matching plugin automatically for you.
